The REST API defined here is for another server to communicate with the tracker devices via the Tracker Server. It has the following features:</p><ol><li><p>Uniform Interface: it is Resource-Based, Manipulation of Resources Through Representations, Selfdescriptive Messages.</p></li><li><p>Stateless: as REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer, statelessness is key. The server does its processing, the appropriate state, or the piece(s) of state that matter, are communicated back to the client via headers, status and response body.</p></li><li><p>Cacheable:self-defined indexesto reduce clientâ€“serverinteractions, furtherimprove scalability and performance.</p></li><li><p>Client-Server: the uniform interface separates clientsfrom servers. Servers are not concerned with the user interface or user state, so that servers can be simpler and more scalable. Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface is not altered.</p></li><li><p>Layered System: a client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling loadbalancing and by providing shared caches. Layers may also enforce security policies.</p></li></ol><h3 id="doc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doc" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Doc</h3><p>The following files are AnyTrek&#39;s Reset API and related interface documents</p>',5),h=e("div",{class:"hint-container tip"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Tips"),e("p",null,[t("You can click the "),e("img",{src:l,alt:"",loading:"lazy"}),t(" to download to local browsing")])],-1);function f(m,v){const a=c("PDF");return s(),i("div",null,[p,n(a,{url:"/file/pdf/RestAPIV2.pdf"}),h])}const y=r(d,[["render",f],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{y as default};
